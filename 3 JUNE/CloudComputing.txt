Cloud computing:
is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

Key Characteristics:

1. On-demand self-service: Users can provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

2. Broad network access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

3. Resource pooling: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.

4. Rapid elasticity or expansion: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

5. Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.


Service Models in Cloud computing is typically offered in three main service models:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. This includes virtual machines, storage, and networking. It offers the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.


2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform for customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. 
Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure App Service, Google App Engine, Heroku.


3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides ready-to-use software applications accessed over the internet, usually on a subscription basis. Cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching.

Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Dropbox.

Deployment Models:
There are also different ways to deploy cloud services:

1. Public Cloud: Cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. Multiple organizations share these resources.

2. Private Cloud: Cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or organization. The services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network, and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to that organization.

3. Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. This model gives businesses greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize their existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

In essence, cloud computing allows individuals and organizations to access and use computing resources more efficiently, scalably, and often more cost-effectively than traditional on-premises solutions.
